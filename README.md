# SwiftRegEx

A playground to learn regular expressions with Swift. We developers obviously know that it's not an easy work to use Regular Expressions. This is my challenge, I would like to add a new and efficient tool to my skills.

### Overview

Before I started, checked some documents also with a few tutorials and decided to go away with [this repository](https://github.com/zeeshanu/learn-regex). So, lots of examples and descriptions are excerpted from repo.

This repository contains a playground project that builds with Xcode 9 and Swift 4.
